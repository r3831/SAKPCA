# SAKPCA
Stochastic approximation for kernel PCA using randomized features
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00934


make the following directories:

mkdir sakpca
mkdir sakpca/code
mkdir sakpca/data

the code should be directly under sakpca/code
the dataset should be directly under sakpca/data.

the data should be in the form mnist.mat, and include a single variable 'X', which is a 784x70000 matrix that includes all MNIST samples (train and test).

just run demo!
